# How to run it yourself

You can run all benchmarks yourself, simply follow the steps outlined below. The
`benchmark.*` scripts run the actual benchmarks and collect the results in the
respective `reports/*.eno` files. The actual report (which gets rendered as this
repository's `README.md`) can be generated by the `report.js` script (see last
section).

## Benchmarks

These measure the performance and store the results.

### JavaScript

```bash
npm i
node benchmark.js
```

### Python

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python benchmark.py
```

### Ruby

```bash
bundle
ruby benchmark.rb
```

## Report

This compiles the report itself:

```bash
npm i # unless you already ran this
node report.js
```
